# Unit-1-Challenge
## Homework assignment for Unit 1: HTML and CSS

## Having read the instructions, I have, to the best of my abilities, done the following:

- cleaned up the CSS to remove duplication and overlapping classes
- added alt text to all images within the web page
- renamed many of the HTML elements to more unique and descriptive tags, rather than overuse of "div" tags
- pushed my files to GitHub and deployed them to a live site through GitHub
- submitted the deployed application URL and GitHub repo to BCS for review and grading
